# History of Monsters

It all started on Halloween.

Frankenstein used to be good. When he was good he made lots of great monster-fighting inventions. He also made different kinds of diamonds using alchemy that give people magic powers.

But one day he went crazy. He went crazy because he spent too much time around monsters. He was as crazy as a wild monkey. Now the monsters are free and you have to stop them and stop crazy frankenstein.
