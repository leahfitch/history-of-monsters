# Basic Game Concepts

__You are fighting monsters!__

There is no set gaming style and it may change from level to level but there are some general game concepts.

## Weapons

There are many different kinds of weapons. They are all inventions or magical creations that Frankenstein left behind before he went crazy. Magical powers are gained through the collection of different types of *diamonds*. Other weapons are picked up throughout the game. Some non-magical weapons are also acquired through diamonds. The player always starts with a level-specific weapon.


### Diamonds

Diamonds come in many colors and have different properties. Here are some of the kinds.

#### Blue

These diamonds give the player resistance to monsters. A player with one blue diamond can be touched by one monster at a time without ill-effects. However, a second, simultaneous monster touch would kill the player. The player can resist one monster touch per blue diamond. E.g., a player with three blue diamonds can be touching 3 monsters without dying.

#### Red

Red diamonds cause the player to magically ignite. The fire does not harm the player but will damage monsters it touches (except those that are fire-resistant).

#### Black

This diamond turns into a magical monster smashing hammer when acquired. It allows the player to harm certain monsters that normally can't be harmed (like ghosts). The hammer disappears after 5 uses.

#### Purple

This, the rarest diamond, causes your player to go into an automatic berserker mode that tears through a significant chunk of a level. You only find purple diamonds in boring spots.


### Suction Gun

This gun is like a big monster vacuum. It sucks up monsters and stashes them in a bag. As the bag gets more full, the player gets bogged down and slow. A level providing this weapon will usually also provide monster receptacles at which the monster bag can be emptied. They don't count as dead until they are placed in a receptacle (for scoring purposes). If the player dies while there are monsters in the bag, they are released back into the level.

### Hammer

Acquired through the black diamond, the hammer can hurt all monsters, including ghosts but it wears out after 5 strikes.

### Golden bow

The player always has the golden bow but it doesn't use arrows. The golden bow let's you shoot the hammer.

## Monsters

### Zombies

Zombies are mostly what you would expect. They are easy to kill and to avoid but there are usually a lot of them. There are some special zombies. Zombies with red shirts throw bombs and zombies with blue shirts are nice and give you bombs.

### Ghosts

Ghosts float around and they can't be hurt except by the hammer. It takes two hammer strikes to get rid of a ghost.

### Cyclops

Cyclops is a big monster. It takes 16 hammer hits to kill. Watch out, the cyclops has more eyes than you think it does. He has a bag of eyes he can throw at you. The eyes explode. He's not a very good shot.

### 9-Headed Dragon

It also has 9 legs and 9 feet. Everything on it is 9. 9 bellies. Its 9 bellies can shoot tanks of harsh gases. If the player is hit, he/she won't be able to breath for a few seconds (stun).


### Grays

These depressing-looking little buggers are gray bubbles with tiny hands and feet. If you touch them, you swell like a balloon and start to float. If the player doesn't collect a blue diamond on the way up, he/she will explode in a minute or two.

### Changelings

If you see a person in front of you that looks like you, strike! Then you won't see a person that looks like you in front of you anymore.

### Nail Biters

These guys attach to walls and doors. When the player touches them, they latch on and cause one diamond to be ineffective. If the player doesn't have any effective diamonds, when a biter latches on, the player dies. Eventually the biters fall off.
